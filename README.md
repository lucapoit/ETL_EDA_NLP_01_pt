# ETL Process with Azure Storage, EDA, and NLP with VADER

This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Azure Storage with the Azure SDK in Python and SQL. The project also includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, followed by sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model for natural language processing (NLP).

## Overview

This project automates the process of extracting data from Azure Storage, transforming the data, and loading it into a SQL database. The data is then analyzed using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights. Finally, natural language processing (NLP) is applied to analyze the sentiment of the text data using the VADER model, providing sentiment scores and classifications.
